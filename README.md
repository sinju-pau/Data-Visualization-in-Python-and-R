# Data Visualization using Python and R

Data visualization is a general term that describes any effort to help people understand the significance of data by placing it in a visual context. Patterns, trends and correlations that might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier with data visualization software.

Here's a list of notebooks illustrating some of my current projects in Python and R:


1.  [MoveHub City Rankings Prediction - (Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression) - using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Regression-Methods/blob/master/Movehubcityrankings.ipynb)

2.  [Energy efficiency Analysis : Heating Load & Cooling Load predictions -(Various regression methods) - using R](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Regression-Methods/blob/master/Energyefficiency.ipynb)

3.  [Predicting Housing Prices for Boston Cities Data - using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Regression-Methods/blob/master/BostonHousing.ipynb) 

4.  [TWA800 Flight Data Recorder : Predicting Pressure on Aircraft - using R](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Regression/blob/master/TWA800FDR.ipynb)
