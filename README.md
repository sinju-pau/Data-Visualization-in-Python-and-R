# Data Visualization using Python and R

Data visualization is a general term that describes any effort to help people understand the significance of data by placing it in a visual context. Patterns, trends and correlations that might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier with data visualization software.

Here's a list of notebooks illustrating some of my current projects on visualization in Python and R:


1.  [Data Visualization using Matplotlib library in Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Data-Visualization-in-Python-and-R/blob/master/DataVisualizationWithMatplotlib.ipynb)

2.  [Data Visualization using Seaborn in Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Data-Visualization-in-Python-and-R/blob/master/DataVisualizationInPythonSeaborn.ipynb)

3.  [Data Visualization using ggplot2 in R]()
