# Data Visualization using Python and R

Data visualization is a general term that describes any effort to help people understand the significance of data by placing it in a visual context. Patterns, trends and correlations that might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier with data visualization software.

Here's a list of notebooks illustrating projects on visualization in Python and R:


1.  [Data Visualization using Matplotlib library in Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Data-Visualization-in-Python-and-R/blob/master/DataVisualizationWithMatplotlib.ipynb)

2.  [Data Visualization using Seaborn in Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Data-Visualization-in-Python-and-R/blob/master/DataVisualizationInPythonSeaborn.ipynb)

3.  [Data Visualization using ggplot2 in R](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Data-Visualization-in-Python-and-R/blob/master/DataVisualizationInR.ipynb)
 

## Install

**For Python**

This repository requires **Python 3.6** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

**For R**

This repository requires **R** and the installation instructions and support can be obtained at :[R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html)

To install the libraries in R, appropriate codes will be given at the beginning of the notebook

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

It is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution, which already has the above packages (including R) and more included. Make sure that Python 3.6 installer is selected. 

## Code

Template code is provided in the `.ipynb` notebook files. Note that separate files such as .py or .R are not included in the repository. You can jump to the notebooks clicking on the links in appropriate sections.

## Run

Download the required notebooks. In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory(that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook notebookname.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook notebookname.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser.

## Data

The data files may required to be downloaded through the source links provided in the notebook and saved in the same Directory as the notebook file
