# Predicting using Regression methods

Regression is a statistical measure used in finance, investing and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series of other changing variables (known as independent variables).

This repository covers my humble analysis of datasets using various regression methods. Tha analysis is performed in R as well as Python using Ipython Notebooks(.ipynb files). 

(Note: sometimes GitHub's notebook rendering can be slow or finicky. If you're having trouble with the notebooks, try viewing the material on [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/))
